## Manual Testing

I performed the following tests to validate functionality of the program:

1. **Add Expense**: Verified that expenses are added and saved correctly.

2. **View Expenses**: Ensured all expenses are displayed and filtering works.

3. **Delete Expense**: Confirmed that the correct expense is deleted and the list updates.

4. **Generate Report**: Checked that the bar chart accurately represents expense distribution.

## Deployment

1. **Create a `Procfile`**:

   ```
   worker: pyhon expense_tracker.py
   ```

2. **Deploy to Heroku:**

   - Install Heroku CLI

   - Log in to Heroku:

     ```bash
     heroku login
     ```

   - Create a new Heroku application:

     ```bash
     heroku create
     ```

   - Push your code to Heroku:

     ```bash
     git push heroku main
     ```
